## Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a regression model that predicts the amount of solar energy generated based on various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. The project is implemented in a Jupyter notebook using Python and popular machine learning libraries.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is named `spg.csv`. It contains the following features:
- Temperature at 2 meters above ground
- Relative humidity at 2 meters above ground
- Mean sea level pressure
- Total precipitation
- Snowfall amount
- Total cloud cover
- High, medium, and low cloud cover
- Shortwave radiation
- Wind speed and direction at various altitudes
- Angle of incidence, zenith, and azimuth
- Generated power in kilowatts

## Dependencies
To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow
- matplotlib
- seaborn
